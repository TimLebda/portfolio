        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I grew up building my own computers and spending time customizing settings and fixing general issues that anyone may run into
            from time to time. But, instead of asking for help, or paying to have the issue resolved, I found it fascinating to discover how to resolve the issue myself.
            Eventually, this lead me to finding a real interest in programming while in college. While I had grown up playing trumpet, which influenced my initial choice of
            major of Music Education, I found learning to program much more fun than learning how to teach music. The underlying mathematical structure of music theory
            seemed to prepare me for the similar regular structures that are used together to build an entire program. As such, I find it stimulating and rewarding to not
            only solve a particular problem via programming, but to do so by way of an aesthetically interesting solution.
          </li>
          <li>Some of my other interests include reading, listening to jazz, visiting museums, and other similar culturally stimulating activities.</li>
        </ul>
